scene <- object with camera.

provide to renderer and renders a frame on canvas. 


render target... 


create a secondary scene with completly different objects. 

provide these to renderer which then instead rendering to canvas,
it renders to render target.

a render target is an intermediate object, which we can use to create texture

and place it to an object within the primary scene.

both scenes can be animated independently with different settings.
